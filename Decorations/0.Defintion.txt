Decoraters in Typescript is some functions that are applied in classes, methods, accessors, properties, parameters
to add metadata for them, or to modify behaviour at built time

- TypeScript calls that function automatically
- It passes information about the target (class, method, property, etc.)
- They are framework-level tools, not everyday JS utilities.
